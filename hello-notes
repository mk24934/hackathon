In short, when trying to deploy to the blockchain do the following:

  0) check truffle.js file, change port to number found in Ganache (settings)
  1) make sure terminal is in the correct working directory
  2) truffle migrate --reset
  3) npm start

----- More notes
0) Install:
  npm install -g truffle
  npm install -g ganache-cli

1) Setting up the blockchain
    Open Ganache

2) Truffle
  # truffle develop # not needed
  truffle compile
      Compile will compile our Solidity code to bytecode
      (the code that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) understands),
      in our case, Ganache emulates the EVM.

  truffle migrate --network development
      Migrate will deploy the code to the blockchain,
      in our case, the blockchain could be found in the network
      “development” we set earlier in the “truffle-config.js” file.

  # truffle console
  # Election.deployed().then(function(instance) { app = instance })
  # app.address
  # app.candidate()

3)
  After editing solidity code to recompile use
  truffle migrate --reset
  truffle console


8) Notes on connecting Metamask to Ganache
https://www.codementor.io/swader/developing-for-ethereum-getting-started-with-ganache-l6abwh62j
    i) highlight and copy the HTTP server in Ganache
    ii) paste into a custom RPC (icon at top of Metamask extension)
    iii) Import account from ganache, by copying the private key
